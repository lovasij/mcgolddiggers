            <h1> Az Internet </h1>
            <p class="alsoszoveg">
                The internet is a global computer network operated using the Internet Protocol (IP). It connects billions of users and enables the operation of distributed systems, such as the World Wide Web (WWW).

                The term originates from the English word "internetwork," which can be translated into Hungarian as 'h치l칩zatok h치l칩zata,' meaning networks of networks. It's a vast system that interconnects smaller computer networks, creating a cyber space alternative to the real world.

                The foundation of the internet is the IP-based network, which links local networks, intranets, and wide-area networks. Data travels through various physical mediums, including telephone lines, cables, and satellites.

                Due to rapid growth, the number of computers connected to the internet is constantly increasing. However, the internet is not just a physical network but also a means of connecting disparate networks.

                Despite its complexity, the protocols that build the internet are accessible to everyone, and they are supported by numerous manufacturers. The commercialization of the internet is significant, no longer limited to researchers and military institutions.

                The internet allows users not only to passively receive information but also to actively participate as information sources. The low cost of internet publishing enables various non-commercial services.

                There is no central building for the internet; each connected network operates independently. The Internet Society (ISOC) oversees coordination and protocol development, headquartered in the state of Virginia.

                The financing of the internet is not straightforward, but typically, individual networks bear their operating costs, while users pay internet service providers who operate the high-speed backbone networks of each country.
