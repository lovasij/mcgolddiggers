                    Vinton Gray Cerf is an American mathematician and computer scientist who is generally referred to as one of the founding fathers of the Internet. He played a key role (both managerially and technically) in the creation of the Internet and the TCP/IP protocol suite.

                    He was the founder of the "Internet Society" in 1992, the purpose of which is to promote the spread of Internet access and use, and to bring together the technical groups developing the Internet. As the first president of ISOC, he held his post until 1999. In 1996, he was awarded the Yuri Rubinsky Memorial Award at the Fifth World Wide Web Conference in Paris. In 1996, he received the SIGCOMM Award for his contributions to the spread of the Internet over 25 years, starting with the development of the TCP/IP protocols. In 1997, Bill Clinton awarded Cerf, along with his partner Robert E. Kahn, the National Medal of Technology (the highest American science and technology award) for their achievements in the development of the Internet and TCP/IP protocols.

                    In 2001, he received the Strowger Award from the J.W. McClure School of Communication at Ohio University. In 2002, together with Bob Kahn, Larry Roberts and Tim Berners-Lee, he was awarded the Premio Principe de Asturias de Investigacion Cientifica, Spain's highest award. In early 2005, it was announced that Cerf and Kahn were the winners of the ACM's 2004 Turing Award (the equivalent of the Nobel Prize in computing) for their pioneering work in the development of basic Internet protocols and interconnected networks, among other things. In November 2005, George W. Bush awarded Cerf and Kahn with the Presidential Medal of Freedom for their contributions to the creation of the Internet. On April 2, 2007, he gave a very successful lecture in Budapest, at the University of Mindentudás, entitled The Freedom of the Internet.
