                    Vannevar Bush was born in Everett on March 11, 1890. American engineer, inventor, and science administrator who headed the United States Office of Scientific Research during World War II. Development (OSRD), through which nearly all wartime military R&D was conducted, including important developments in radar and the initiation and early administration of the Manhattan Project. He emphasized the importance of scientific research to national security and economic prosperity, and was largely responsible for the movement that led to the creation of the National Science Foundation. Bush joined the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1919 and founded the company that became the Raytheon Company in 1922. the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1938.

                    During his career, Bush patented a number of his own inventions. He is particularly known for his engineering work on analog computers and memex. Beginning in 1927, Bush constructed a differential analyzer, a mechanical analog computer with some digital components that could solve differential equations with up to 18 independent variables. One branch of the work done by Bush and others at MIT was the beginning of the theory of digital circuit design. Memex, which he began developing in the 1930s, was a hypothetical adjustable microfilm viewer with a structure similar to that of hypertext. memex and Bush's 1945 essay "As We May Think" influenced generations of computer scientists who drew inspiration from his vision of the future. Bush was appointed to the National Aeronautics Advisory Committee in 1938 and soon became its chairman. As chairman of the National Defense Research Committee and later as director of the OSRD, Bush coordinated the activities of about six thousand leading American scientists in the field of applying science to warfare. As head of the NDRC and OSRD, he initiated the Manhattan Project and ensured that it received high priority from the highest levels of government. And Bush graduated from Chelsea High School in 1909. He then attended Tufts College. After graduating in 1913, he obtained both Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees.

                    In 1924, Bush and Marshall teamed up with physicist Charles G. Smith, who invented a voltage regulator tube called the S-tube. Beginning in 1927, Bush constructed a differential analyzer, an analog computer that could solve differential equations with up to 18 independent variables. Bush introduced the concept of memex in the 1930s, which he envisioned as a form of memory augmentation with a microfilm-based "device in which an individual stores all his books, notes, and communications, and which is computerized to consult with extraordinary speed and flexibility. At age 84, died in Belmont, Massachusetts of pneumonia on June 28, 1974.
