                    Roberts, nicknamed Larry, was born and raised in Westport, Connecticut, in 1946. His parents, Elizabeth (Gilman) and Elliott John Roberts, both held doctorates in chemistry. It's said that during his youth, he built a Tesla coil, assembled a television, and designed a telephone network built from transistors for his parents' Girl Scout camp.

                    Roberts attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he received his bachelor's degree (1959), master's degree (1960), and Ph.D. (1963), all in electrical engineering. His Ph.D. thesis, titled "Machine Perception of Three-Dimensional Solids," focused on computer vision.
                    His career continued at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory after earning his Ph.D. Roberts developed an interest in time-sharing using computer networks after reading J.C.R. Licklider's seminal 1961 paper on the "Intergalactic Computer Network."
                    In 1967, despite initial reluctance, he was recruited by Robert Taylor in the ARPA Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) to become the program manager for the ARPANET. There, he met Paul Baran in February 1967 but did not initially discuss networks. Instead, he asked Frank Westervelt to explore initial design questions for a network.

                    In 1973, Roberts left ARPA to join BBN's effort to commercialize packet-switching technology in the form of Telenet, the first FCC-licensed public data network in the United States. He served as its CEO from 1973 to 1980. Roberts joined the international effort to standardize a protocol for packet switching based on virtual circuits shortly before its finalization.
                    Later in his career, Roberts served as President of DHL Corporation in 1983. He predicted that bandwidths would decrease due to voice compression technology. He held CEO positions at NetExpress from 1983 to 1993 and was president of ATM Systems from 1993 to 1998. Additionally, he was chairman and CTO of Caspian Networks, and later founded and chaired Anagran Inc. until 2011.
                    Since September 2012, he has served as CEO of Netmax in Redwood City, California.
