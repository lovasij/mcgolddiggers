                    Born on April 29, 1926 in Grodno, he was an American-Jewish engineer who pioneered the development of computer networks. One of the two independent inventors of the circuit, which is now the basis of data communication in computer networks, the former packet, he founded many companies and developed other technologies that are part of modern digital communication. His family moved to the United States in Boston on May 11, 1928.

                    He graduated from Drexel University in 1949 with a degree in electrical engineering. joined the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Company, where he did technical work on the first US commercial computer brand, the UNIVAC models. In 1955 he married Evelyn Murphy, moved to Los Angeles and worked for Hughes Aircraft on radar data processing systems. He received his engineering degree from UCLA in 1959. While Baranben remained at UCLA to earn his doctorate, the onset of a heavy travel and work schedule forced him to abandon his doctoral work. After joining the RAND Corporation in 1959, Baran set out to design a "survivable" communications system capable of maintaining end-to-end communications despite damage from nuclear weapons during the Cold War. Using computing technology of the day, Baran and his team developed a simulation simulation to test the appropriate connectivity of an array of nodes with varying degrees of connectivity. After On Distributed Communications was published, he presented his team's findings to a variety of audiences, including AT&T engineers.

                    In 1968, Baran was the founder of the Future Institute, and later participated in other networking technologies developed in Silicon Valley. In the early 1980s, Baran founded PacketCable, Inc. He founded Telebit after creating its discrete multi-tone modem technology in the mid-1980s. In 1985, Baran founded Metricom, the first wireless Internet company that launched Ricochet, the first public wireless mesh networking system. In 1992, he also founded an early cable modem company called Com21. In addition to his innovation in network products, he is also credited with inventing the first door gun detector. He received an honorary doctorate when he delivered the commencement address at Drexel in 1997. Baran died in Palo Alto, California at the age of 84 on March 26, 2011.
